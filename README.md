# YZU_Introduction to Digital Systems Lab.(II)
```
Digital Systems Lab class in spring semester of sophomore year (2024S/1122)
```

### Course Name:
- 數位系統實驗（二） / Introduction to Digital Systems Lab.(II)

### Teacher:
- 林明義 / Ming-Yi Lin

### Time:
- 2024S(1122), 09:10-12:00

### Intros:
- This course introduces some basic concept about digital system.
- Using hardware description language (HDL) to model combinational circuit and sequential circuit.
- Learning the knowledge about Computer-aided Design (CAD) and Electronic Design Automatic (EDA).

### Guidelines:
- There are 15 folders represent each lab respectively. 
- For Lab01 to Lab03, it contains 1 problem file (.pptx) and some subfolders. There is no HDL code accroding to the problem.
- For others, it contains 1 problem file (.ppt, .pptx, or .pdf file), 1 or more VHDL or Verilog solutions, and subfolders which store whole project files generated by Altera FPGA when developing circuit. 
- That is, in every folder started from Lab04, the file with ".vhd" or ".v" is the code for each lab. Subfolders are the entire project.
